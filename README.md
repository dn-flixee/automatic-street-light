# automatic-street-light
## Introduction

```Smart Street light is an automated system which automates the street Light. The main aim of Smart Street light is to reduce the power consumption when there are no vehicle movements on the road. The system will glow with high intensity.```

```The components used are Arduino UNOR3, IR sensor module, Light dependent resistor module (LDR) and LED’s```

## Working

```the system works in accordance with the varying sunlight. Whenever there is sufficient sunlight in surroundings, LDR exhibits high resistance and acts as an insulator, while in darkness LDR behaves as low resistance path and allows the flows of electricity,LDR’s operates with the help of IR sensors, these sensors are activated under low light conditions and are controlled by an AT89C51 micro controller(Arduino UNOR3) , every basic electronic circuit will operate under regulated 5v DC.```
```When any vehicle is detected by IR, all the three street lights glow otherwise only one street light remains on, this is done so to provide visibilty to the drivers and to maintain road safety.```
